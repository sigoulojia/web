        description: "This showreel brings together the projects I worked on over the past year — events, commercials, music sessions, and independent films. Each frame comes from a real collaboration, a real moment, and a real story. As a filmmaker, I’m drawn to harmony: between image and sound, movement and stillness, people and space. Whether I’m filming a live event, a brand, or a personal project, my goal is always the same — to create visuals that feel honest, cinematic, and alive. This reel isn’t just a collection of shots. It’s a reflection of a year of learning, experimenting, and pushing my visual language further. Every project shaped my approach, sharpened my eye, and reinforced why I do this work. This is my journey over the last year — told through light, rhythm, and emotion.",
